## Recent Session Work (January 29, 2026 - Dialog Wrapping Finalization)

### ✅ Dialog Formatting Perfected - Fresh Line & Smart Wrapping
**Location:** [Line 3081](src/ESP32MUD.cpp#L3081) - `announceDialogToRoom()` function  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All dialogs now wrap perfectly at 80 columns

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Fresh Telnet Line Start:** Dialog now begins on a new line (not after prompt character)
   - Adds `println("")` before dialog to clear the line after previous prompt
   - Ensures full 80 columns available for first line calculation

2. **Smart Width Calculation:** First line wraps with reduced width
   - Calculates prefix length: `"The Speaker says: \""`
   - First line: `80 - prefix_length` characters for dialog
   - Subsequent lines: Full 80-character width
   - All breaks ONLY occur at word boundaries (spaces)

3. **Perfect Word Wrapping:**
   - No mid-word splits (words never break at character position)
   - Complete re-wrap at fresh telnet lines for optimal display
   - Pattern: Single unified algorithm with adaptive line width

**Example Output (80 columns):**
```
The Part of a Statue says: "I've been treated very unfairly. Those killings
were strictly for entertainment."
```

**Build & Deployment v26.01.29 (Final):**
- **Compilation Time:** 27.52 seconds  
- **Binary Size:** 1,380,700 bytes (65.8% of Flash)
- **Memory Usage:** 60,844 bytes (18.6% of RAM)
- **Upload Time:** 10.4 seconds via COM5
- **Build Status:** ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **GitHub:** Commit 3549802 pushed successfully

## Recent Session Work (January 29, 2026 - Global Prompt System Complete)

### ✅ Universal Prompt Display After All Room Announcements
**Requirement:** After EVERY announcement to room, display `>` prompt on new line with no exceptions
**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Updated Functions:**
- `announceToRoomWrapped()` [Line 3023](src/ESP32MUD.cpp#L3023): Added blank line + prompt
- `announceToRoomExcept()` [Line 2099](src/ESP32MUD.cpp#L2099): Added blank line + prompt
- `announceDialogToRoom()` [Line 3081](src/ESP32MUD.cpp#L3081): Dialog with full wrapping + prompt

**Pattern Applied to All:**
```cpp
// After announcement content
players[i].client.println("");  // blank line separator
players[i].client.print("> ");  // prompt on fresh line
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Dialog announcements (NPC yells, item messages)
- ✅ Regular room announcements (text output)
- ✅ Announcements excluding specific players
- ✅ All combat-related messages
- ✅ All item/world messages
- ✅ All system announcements

**Build & Deployment v26.01.29 (Updated):**

## Recent Session Work (January 29, 2026 - Dialog Wrapping & Magic Shop)

### ✅ NPC/Item Dialog Word-Wrapping Implementation
**Feature:** All NPC combat dialogs and item dialogs now wrap at 80 characters
**Code Location:** [Line 3081](src/ESP32MUD.cpp#L3081) - `announceDialogToRoom()` function

**How It Works:**
- Starts dialog on fresh telnet line (after previous prompt)
- Calculates width based on speaker prefix length
- Wraps dialog text at 80-char boundary by word only

### ✅ Enchanted Arcana Magic Shop Created
**Location:** Voxel (254, 247, 50)  
**Shop Type:** Magic items, potions, and enchanted weapons

**Inventory (10 Items):**
- **Potions (20-50gp):** Healing, Mana, Strength, Invisibility (4 items)
- **Rings & Amulets (100-200gp):** Protection, Wisdom (2 items)

## Recent Session Work (January 28, 2026 - File Sync & Server Cleanup)

### ✅ File Upload Server Removed
**Removed:** Port 8080 file upload server initialization from setup()
- **Reason:** No longer needed; manual `download all` command provides on-demand control
- **Cleanup:** Removed FILE_UPLOAD_SERVER initialization block and all references
- **Code Location:** setup() function, was interfering with auto-sync timing
- **Status:** Successfully removed, code compiles cleanly

### ✅ Auto-Sync at Boot Made Optional
**Location:** Line 18006 in setup()  
**Action:** Commented out `autoSyncFilesAtBoot()` call
**Rationale:** 
- Avoids unnecessary HTTP requests every boot
- Wizards can manually control sync with `download all` command
- Reduces boot time when server unavailable
- Function remains in codebase for future re-enablement
**Manual Control:** Wizard command `download all` syncs all 6 files at 36.7 KB/s (73× faster than individual downloads)

### 📊 Performance Metrics (Latest Build v26.01.28)
- **Compilation Time:** 27.66 seconds
- **Binary Size:** 1,373,564 bytes (65.5% of Flash)
- **Memory Usage:** 60,844 bytes (18.6% of RAM)
- **Upload Time:** 10.7 seconds via COM5
- **Build Status:** ✅ 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **SHA Verification:** ✅ Passed
- **Device:** ESP32C3 XIAO (160MHz, 320KB RAM, 4MB Flash)

### ✅ Build & Deployment Successful
- **Task:** 🔄 Reset and Upload (executed successfully)
- **Serial Port:** COM5
- **Baud Rate:** 460800 kbit/s effective write speed
- **All Features:** Working (download, auto-sync optional, manual control via wizard)
- **GitHub Status:** Ready for next push

## Game Rules - High-Low Card Game

- **Minimum Bet:** 10gp
- **Maximum Bet:** coins/2 (must afford 2x loss for POST)
- **Ace Declaration:** First Ace shows alone, player declares HIGH(2) or LOW(1)
- **Double Ace:** Second card is Ace → automatically set to opposite of first declaration, then both shown for betting opportunity
- **Outcomes:**
  - WIN: 3rd card strictly between [lowerCard, higherCard] → pocket bet, pot -= bet
  - LOSE: 3rd card outside range → lose bet, pot += bet
  - POST: 3rd card equals 1st or 2nd card → lose 2x bet, pot += 2x bet
  - Double Ace allows full 1-14 range, but 3rd Ace triggers POST loss

- Starts at 50gp
- Shared by ALL players (not per-player)
- Increases when players lose/post
- Decreases when player wins
- Displayed: "Pot is at XXXgp.  You have [Y] gold coins."
- Resets to 50gp when depleted (player wins entire pot)

## CRITICAL: Input Handling Pattern for Prompt Flags

**When creating other games that use prompt flags (awaitingContinue, awaitingResponse, etc.):**

**NEVER rely on handleCommand() for empty input!** The main input loop at line ~14260 rejects empty input with "What?" BEFORE handleCommand is ever called.

**Solution:** Check for prompt flags in the MAIN LOOP (before the empty input rejection):

```cpp
// In main game loop, BEFORE "if (line.length() == 0)" check:
if (i >= 0 && i < MAX_PLAYERS && sessions[i].gameActive && sessions[i].awaitingPrompt) {
    if (line.length() == 0) {
        // Handle empty input for prompt
        sessions[i].awaitingPrompt = false;
        continueGame(players[i], i);
        p.client.print("> ");
        continue;
    } else if (line == "end" || line == "quit") {
        endGame(players[i], i);
        p.client.print("> ");
        continue;
    }
    // ... handle other valid inputs ...
}

// THEN do the normal empty input rejection:
if (line.length() == 0) {
    if (p.loggedIn) p.client.println("What?");
    continue;
}
```

**Location:** Around line 14260 in handleCommand call area
**Pattern:** Check game state BEFORE cleanInput/empty rejection

---

## Latest Session Updates (Late Evening - Final Polish)

✅ **Card2 Redraw Logic:** Automatically redraw card2 if:

**What:** Full chess game at Game Parlor (247,248,50) as Game #2  
**How:** Type `play 2` to start. White moves first. Enter moves as: `d2d4` (from-square to-square in algebraic notation)  
**Win:** Checkmate opponent (or they resign)  
**Draw:** Stalemate (no legal moves, not in check)  
**End:** Type 'end', 'quit', or 'resign'

## Game Rules

- **Starting Position:** Standard chess (white on ranks 1-2, black on ranks 7-8)
- **Move Format:** Algebraic notation `d2d4` (from d2 to d4)
- **Piece Movements:** All standard chess rules enforced
  - Pawns: Forward movement, diagonal capture, double-move from starting rank
  - Knights: L-shaped moves (2+1 squares)
  - Bishops: Diagonal movement with clear path checking
  - Rooks: Straight movement (horizontal/vertical) with clear path checking
  - Queens: Combined rook + bishop moves
  - Kings: One square in any direction
- **King Safety:** Moves leaving king in check rejected automatically
- **Castling:** Not implemented (simplified variant)
- **En Passant:** Not implemented (simplified variant)
- **Promotion:** Pawns reaching final rank promote to queen
- **Game End:** Checkmate, stalemate, or resignation

## Board Encoding

**64-Square Array** representing 8x8 chessboard (0-12 piece encoding):
- 0 = Empty
- 1-6 = White pieces (1=Pawn, 2=Knight, 3=Bishop, 4=Rook, 5=Queen, 6=King)
- 7-12 = Black pieces (7=Pawn, 8=Knight, 9=Bishop, 10=Rook, 11=Queen, 12=King)
- Board layout: Rank 1-2 bottom (white), Rank 7-8 top (black)
- Files: a-h (left to right), Ranks: 1-8 (bottom to top)

## Move Validation Logic

✅ **Piece Ownership:** Only move own pieces (white 1-6, black 7-12)  
✅ **Piece Movement Rules:** Each piece has specific movement patterns
  - Sliding pieces (bishop/rook/queen): Verify clear path
  - Pawns: Forward movement, captures diagonal
  - Knights: L-shaped moves (ignore blocking pieces)
  - Kings: One square in any direction
✅ **Path Clearing:** Bishops, rooks, queens cannot jump over pieces  
✅ **Capture Rules:** Can capture opponent pieces, not own pieces  
✅ **King Safety:** Move is illegal if leaves/puts king in check  
✅ **Pawn Promotion:** Pawn reaching rank 8 → becomes queen

## Game Flow

1. **Initialization:** Players assigned White/Black, board set to standard position
2. **Player Move Input:** Parse notation (d2d4) → Convert to board indices
3. **Move Validation:** Check piece ownership, movement rules, path clearing, king safety
4. **Apply Move:** Update board state
5. **Check Detection:** Test if current king in check, or if no legal moves (stalemate vs checkmate)
6. **Engine Response:** Computer finds legal move, applies it
7. **Game End Conditions:**
   - Checkmate: Opponent has no legal moves AND king in check
   - Stalemate: Current player has no legal moves AND king NOT in check
   - Resignation: Player types 'resign' or 'end'
